## Issue #10: Warn the user if they enter the same name twice

**Status**: New issue
**Type**: Requires tests

### Files Read:
- src/EnterNames.js
- tests/edge-cases.spec.js

### Test Written:
Added test to verify duplicate name warning functionality.

File: tests/regression.spec.js
- Test name: 'warns user when entering duplicate name to prevent confusion'
- Purpose: Validates that users cannot accidentally add the same person twice
- Expected behavior: Text box turns pink with red border, error message appears above text box

### Test Run (Should Fail):
```
npm run test:e2e

  1) warns user when entering duplicate name to prevent confusion
     Expected error message to be visible, but it was not found
```

‚úì Test fails for the correct reason: duplicate detection not implemented yet

### Implementation:
Added duplicate name detection to EnterNames.js:

Files modified:
- src/EnterNames.js:
  - Added state for error: `const [duplicateError, setDuplicateError] = useState(false)`
  - Added check in handleAddName to detect duplicates
  - Added conditional className for error state
  - Added error message display above text box
- src/App.css:
  - Added .name-input-error class with pink background and red border

### Test Run (Should Pass):
```
npm run test:e2e -- tests/regression.spec.js

  ‚úì warns user when entering duplicate name to prevent confusion (450ms)
```

‚úì Test now passes

## Example: When to STOP

```
## Issue #14: In the apply couple UI, if you hit apply couple twice...

**Status**: New issue
**Type**: Requires analysis

### Issue Analysis:
This issue description suggests changing the button behavior, but there are multiple possible approaches:

1. Replace "Apply Couple" button with "Remove Couple" button after application
2. Toggle the button text between "Apply" and "Remove"
3. Make the button a toggle that shows visual state
4. Hide the button entirely and show configured couples in a list

STOPPING: Multiple equally valid implementation approaches exist.

**Question for user:** Which approach would you prefer for the couple management UI?
```
