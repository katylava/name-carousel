# ðŸŽ  Professor Putterwump's Curious Carousel of Unreturned Names

A delightful Victorian circus-themed name exchange draw application for gift
exchanges, Secret Santa events, and any situation requiring fair random matching
with exclusion rules.

  won't give to A)

  be matched together
- **Year-over-Year Support**: Import previous year's draw to automatically
  exclude repeat matches
- **Animated Reveals**: Configurable animation speed for dramatic name reveals
- **Export & Share**: Save results as JSON, plain text, or shareable PNG images
- **Offline-First**: All data stays in your browser - nothing sent to servers

  typography
