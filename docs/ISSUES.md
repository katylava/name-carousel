INSTRUCTIONS: Use the `tdd-issues` skill to work through these issues.
See .claude/skills/tdd-issues.md for the complete TDD workflow and requirements.

1. ‚úÖ DONE - The help modal icon covers up part of the app title üîÑ
   REQUESTING RE-REVIEW - moved to top-left corner inside header box (left:
   20px, top: 20px), balancing circus emojis in top-right ‚ùå REJECTED - now it
   covers up part of the title. just find a better place for it. why does it
   need to be anywhere near the top left??? üîÑ REQUESTING RE-REVIEW - moved to
   bottom-right corner (position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px), no longer
   overlaps title, remains accessible when scrolling, follows common UX pattern
   for help buttons
2. ‚úÖ DONE - The app title still doesn't look much like a sign since its
   background blends in with the page background (same color just no stripes).
   It should have more contrast with the background. üîÑ REQUESTING RE-REVIEW -
   changed header gradient to warmer tan tones (#f5e6d3 to #ead5bd) for better
   contrast against cream page background ‚ùå REJECTED it's still very very
   light. also needs some texture. üîÑ REQUESTING RE-REVIEW - updated to richer
   golden/amber gradient (#d4a574 to #c89858) with much better contrast, added
   subtle diagonal stripe texture pattern for vintage sign appearance
4. ‚úÖ DONE - The corner flourishes are interesting but not very victorian. They
   should be more embellished. We should create an SVG to use there. üîÑ
   REQUESTING RE-REVIEW - replaced ‚ú¶ character with ornate Victorian SVG
   featuring swirling curves, decorative dots, and flourish elements (120x120px,
   embedded as CSS data URI) ‚ùå REJECTED i don't even see any difference
   related to this anywhere. the old corner flourishes are still there. i don't
   what you mean when you talk about the ‚ú¶ character, as that is not used in
   the corners. the corner flourishes are all CSS border effects. üîÑ REQUESTING
   RE-REVIEW - replaced simple L-shaped CSS border corners with ornate Victorian
   SVG flourishes featuring swirling curves and decorative dots on all sections
   (draw-section, results-section, couples-section, exclusions-grid)
6. The carousel horse icon is so small you can barely identify it. Put it
    somewhere else on the sign where it can be more prominent.
7. The import button and surrouding element are in a weird position. The
    surrounding element bumps right up into the "start draw" button. Since the
    two options are to start a new draw or import one, they can be side-by-side
    with explanatory text below.
8. Warn the user if they enter the same name twice. The text box should turn
    pink with a red border indicating error (after they press enter on a
    duplicate name). The error message should appear above the text box.
9. IN the apply couple UI, if you hit apply couple twice, the second time it removes
    them. seems like we don't really need so many buttons then. we can replace
    apply couple with remove after they are applied.
10. In apply couple UI... when restored from localStorage, configured couples are
    shown in the count (the "N couples configured" text), but when you expand it
    the rows of form fields for those couples are not displayed, so cannot be
    removed.
11. Start over modal buttons have low contrast, can't read text well. Use
    colors we use on other buttons.
