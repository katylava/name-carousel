See .claude/skills/tdd-issues.md for the complete TDD workflow and requirements.

8. âœ… DONE - Warn the user if they enter the same name twice. The text box should turn
    pink with a red border indicating error (after they press enter on a
    duplicate name). The error message should appear above the text box.
9. IN the apply couple UI, if you hit apply couple twice, the second time it removes
    them. seems like we don't really need so many buttons then. we can replace
    apply couple with remove after they are applied.
10. In apply couple UI... when restored from localStorage, configured couples are
    shown in the count (the "N couples configured" text), but when you expand it
    the rows of form fields for those couples are not displayed, so cannot be
    removed.
11. Start over modal buttons have low contrast, can't read text well. Use
    colors we use on other buttons.
12. The PNG does not display the results in carousel order like the web page
    does.
