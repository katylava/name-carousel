16. âœ… DONE When you start over, not everything is cleared out -- quick set up
    couples form still has form values populated (though not applied) from
    previously. If the names are different than the new names, the same number
    of rows still show up but with no names selected. IOW, if I add two couples
    like alice/bob and edith/frank, then start over with the names alice, bob,
    charlie, dave -- when I get to the exclusions page it says 0 couples
    applied, but upon expantion I see two couple rows... one with alice and bob
    selected but not applied, and one where both names still need to be
    selected.
